# Admin Guide: Teams & Invites

Teams and Invites let you control who can see and join specific exercises.

**Three visibility options:**

- Multiple exercises for the same group
- Easier than inviting individuals repeatedly

### When to Use Invites
- One-off participants
- Mixed groups from different teams
- External collaborators

### Combining Approaches
You can have:
- Some public exercises for general participation
- Team exercises for specific cohorts
- Invite-only exercises for special cases

## FAQ

**Q: Can a user be in multiple teams?**
A: Yes, they'll see exercises from all their teams.

**Q: What happens if I remove someone from a team mid-exercise?**
A: They lose access to team-only exercises but keep their existing participation data.

**Q: Can I change visibility after participants have joined?**
A: Yes, but be careful - changing to team_only or invite_only may hide the exercise from current participants who aren't in the team/invited.

**Q: Do team members auto-join exercises?**
A: No, team membership gives visibility. Users still need to click "Join" to participate.
